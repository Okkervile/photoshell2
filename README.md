photoshell2
===========

a very simple shell in C for mac to control libgphoto2

I used libgphoto2 2.5.2 on MacOs 10.9

it gives a shell prompt on which one can enter 4 commands

gpopen: establish connections to camera
gpclose:
preview take one preview picture and safe it to disk with ascending numbers
autofocuse

its coming with Makefile
